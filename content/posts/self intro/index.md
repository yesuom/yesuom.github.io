I'm a law student but interested in Computational Neuroscience, Psychology and AI now. So I need to learn a lot about these themes.

To document the journey of this career transition, connect with more people who share the same interests, and provide references for those who, like me, are looking to switch careers, I would like to share my experiences and study notes on this website.

曾经怀着一腔热血和对正义的向往进入了法学院，却发现自己并不喜欢这里。后来出于对智能与人性本质的追寻修读了心理学双学位，并逐渐喜欢上神经建模、认知建模和人工智能。

目前正在积极学习相关知识，并希望通过博客记录自己的学习过程。
